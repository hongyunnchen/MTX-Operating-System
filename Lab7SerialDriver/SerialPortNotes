Chapter 10.6, Serial Port Driver

A serial port is a communication interface through which information transfers
in and out ONE BIT AT A TIME (in contrast to a parallel port). Serial ports
transfer data from computers to modems, printers, terminals, etc.

Data Terminal Equipment: computer (usually male)
Data Communication Equipment: modem or serial printer (usually female)

To establish a serial connection between a DTE and DCE:
1. computer asserts the Data Terminal Ready
    (informs the serial that its ready)
2. serial responds by asserting Data Set Ready and Data Carrier Detect
    (informs the computer that its ready too)
3. when the computer has data to send, it asserts Request To Send
    (asks the serial for request to send)
4. if the serial is ready to receive data, it asserts Clear To Send
5. computer can send data through Tx while CTS is on
6. serial can send data through Rx to the computer anytime without asking first

Most PCs have two serial ports, called COM1 and COM2. These are DTEs by default,
and intended to connect to DCEs.

A Serial Terminal generates ASCII code. A virtual serial terminal is a device that
emulates a real serial terminal.

Each serial port is represented by a stty structure:
  struct stty {
    // input section
    char inbuf[BUFLEN]; //stores input chars
    int inhead,intail;
    SEMAPHORE inchars; //for synchronization

    // output section
    char outbuf[BUFLEN]; //stores outgoing chars
    int outhead,outtail;
    SEMAPHORE outspace; //for synchronization

    // Control section
    char erase,kill,intr; //control chars
    char x_on,x_off,tx_on;

    // I/O port base address
    int port;
  } stty[NSTTY]; // NSTTY = mumber of serial ports
